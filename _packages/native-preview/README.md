# TypeScript (Native Preview)

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

This package provides a preview build of the native port of TypeScript.
Not all features are implemented yet.

This package is intended for testing and experimentation.
It will eventually be replaced by the official TypeScript package.

## Usage

Use the `tsgo` command just like you would use `tsc`:

```sh
npx tsgo --help
```
